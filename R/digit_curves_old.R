#' Calculate semilandmarks along a curve
#'
#' A function to calculate equidistant two-dimensional and three-dimensional semilandmarks along a curve. These landmarks will be treated as "sliders" in Generalized Procrustes analysis [gpagen()]. This type of semilandmark "slides" along curves lacking known landmarks (see Bookstein 1997 for algorithm details). Each sliding semilandmark ("sliders") will slide between two designated points, along a line tangent to the specified curvature, as specified by [define.sliders()]. 
#' 
#' The function is based upon tpsDig2 'resample curve by length' for 2D data by James Rohlf.
#' The start of the curve is a fixed landmark on the curve that is equivalent (homologous) in each specimen in the sample (and will be treated as a fixed point during Procrustes Superimpoistion using [gpagen()]). Then nPoints are calculated along the curve at equidistant points from the start to the end. 
#' 
#' 'curve' is a p-x-k matrix of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve. This can be the pixels of an outline calculated in ImageJ (save xy coordinates) or any other reasonable way of obtaining ordered coorinates along a curve (including sampling by hand using 
#' [digit.fixed()] or [digitize2d()] - but note that there should be more points defining the curve than nPoints in order to accurately calculate the semilandmarks).
#'
#' If 'closed = T', the function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark plus nPoints. If 'closed = F', the function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark, plus nPoints and the end of the curve. 
#'
#' @param start A vector of x,y,(z) coordinates for the fixed landmark defining the start of the curve
#' @param curve A p-x-k matrix of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve
#' @param nPoints Numeric how many semilandmarks to place equidistantly along the curve 
#' @param closed Logical Whether the curve is closed (TRUE) or open (FALSE)
#' @return Function returns a matrix of coordinates for nPoints equally spaced semilandmarks sampled along the curve (plus start and end if 'closed = F', or only including start if 'closed = T') 
#' @seealso [digit.fixed()] [digitize2d()]
