#' @title Transform mesh into an undirected igraph object
#' @description Transforms a given mesh into an undirected igraph object for
#' shortest paths and other queries.
#' @author Cornel M. Pop
#' @keywords internal
#' @param mesh a mesh3d object
#' @return A list containing a) "graph", an igraph object; b) "gVertices", a
#' numeric vector of graph vertices; and c) "edge.curv", a numeric vector
#' of edge curvature values, computed by adding values for the defining vertices
#' @note 
#' This is a very simple function which creates an igraph object from a mesh
#' and computes edge weights on the basis of vertex curvature values. The only
#' reason this has been implemented as a separate function is that it is cached,
#' meaning that repeated calls on the same object (e.g. from sPathQuery) are
#' fast.

#' Computes shortest geodesic path between two mesh vertices
#' @description Computes the shortest path between two mesh vertices following
#' triangle edges (i.e. connected vertices) on a target mesh using either
#' a weighted or unweighted algorithm.
#' @param sv_id numeric ID of the "from" vertex, corresponding to the row number 
#' in the transposed mesh$vb (i.e. t(mesh$vb))
#' @param ev_id numeric ID of the "to" vertex, corresponding to the row number in
#' the transposed mesh$vb
#' @param mesh a mesh3d object. Please ensure it is uniformly sampled.
#' @param path.choice path choice specification. Options are: a) "ridges", to
#' give preference to positive curvature zones (i.e. ridges), b) "valleys", to
#' give preference to negative curvature zones, or c) "any" for unweighted
#' path search.
#' @return A numeric, ordered list of all vertex IDs in the path (includes
#' start and end vertices)
#' @note 
#' 1. The first query will be quite a bit slower than subsequent queries
#' because the helper mesh_to_graph function is cached. Still, with demoFlake
#' the performance of this function is pretty slow at the moment (~5calls per
#' second).
#' 2. The algorithm used for finding the shortest path is chosen by the 
#' underlying igraph package. As per the igraph documentation, with unweighted
#' edges, as is the case here, a default unweighted algorithm is chosen even if
#' another algorithm is explicitly requested.
#' 3. The performance of this function is highly dependent on the degree to which
#' the mesh is uniformly sampled. Please consider remeshing before running it.
#' The following example assumes your mesh is called ply:
#' 
#' ply <- vcgUniformRemesh(ply, voxelSize=median(vcgMeshres(ply)$edgelength))
#' 
#' 
#' TODO: Allow for function to work directly on igraph objects also; it'd improve
#' performance by 300%, which may be significant to functions that make hundreds
#' of calls

#' Connect landmarks by the shortest geodesic path

#' Note also that, internally, this function uses sPathQuerry and mapOnMesh, so

#' discrepancies with input landmarks that are already mapped onto the mesh
#' surface. See mapOnMesh documentation for more information.
#' 
#' Finally, note that this function can return duplicated vertex ID sequences
#' (i.e. path tracks back on itself near input coordinates), which may cause
#' problems with, for example, geomorph::digit.curves
