\title{Compute the intersection points of a ray and a set of triangles}
\usage{
sRayTrace(o, d, v0, v1, v2, epsilon)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A matrix-like (N x 3) object with the coordinate of the ray origin
repeated so that the number of rows (N) matches the number of triangles.}

\item{d}{A matrix-like (N x 3) object with the direction of the ray (i.e.
the difference between an arbitrary point along the line and the x, y, and z
coordinate of the ray's origin) repeated so that the number of rows (N)
matches the number of triangles.}

\item{v0}{A matrix-like (N x 3) object with the (x,y,z) coordinates of the
first vertex for each of the N triangles.}

\item{v1}{A matrix-like (N x 3) object with the (x,y,z) coordinates of the
second vertex for each of the N triangles.}

\item{v2}{A matrix-like (N x 3) object with the (x,y,z) coordinates of the
third vertex for each of the N triangles.}

\item{epsilon}{The floating point precision used to check whether the angle
formed by the ray and the plane of the triangles is +/- zero (i.e. whether
the ray is parallel).}
}
\value{
a (N x 3) matrix containing the coordinates of the intersection
points.
}
\description{
Computes the intersection point(s) of a ray and an arbitrarily
large set of triangles using the algorithm of Moller and Trumbore (1997).
}
\note{
This function was inspired by the Matlab toolbox developed by Jaroslaw
Tuszynski (2011-2014). In theory this function can be used as-is to test the
intersection of multiple rays/multiple triangles, but in practice doing so
requires much more memory (nr. triangles * nr. rays) and offers very marginal
improvements in execution speed.
